Learning Grids
==============

Working Examples (and study guide) of Grids in CSS3, Less, Sass, and CSS4 polyfills with Rework and PostCSS.

Libraries:

- Bootstrap (less)
- Brush (stylus)
- Frameless (less)
- Gridism (css3)
- Flexbox (css3)
- Postcss (css4)
- Skeleton (css3)
- Susy (sass)

... and more.

## Workflow

Templates are written in plain HTML5. Bower is used to manage dependencies. Npm, with its powerful scripting
abilities, is used as a build tool. To start a live reloading server that compiles _any_ stylesheet, run:

	npm start

## Credits

Initial HTML templates and styles were ported from the original examples from the respective websites. I've removed
unncessary styles to focus working examples entirely on grids. In addition, these fine designers have helped me
understand how grids work within the context of their libraries:
